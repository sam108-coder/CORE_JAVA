Ans-> JDK (Java Development Kit):
      It's a full-featured software development kit (SDK) used for Java development.
      The JDK includes the JRE, along with tools like the compiler (javac), debuggers,
      and other utilities needed for Java application development.

      JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
      The JRE is a subset of the JDK.
      It provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.
      Essentially, it's the part of the JDK that allows you to run Java applications.

      JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
      The JVM is the core of the Java platform and is included in both JDK and JRE.
      It executes the Java bytecode, providing an environment for Java code to run.
      The JVM is platform-independent, meaning it allows Java applications to run on any device or operating system.
